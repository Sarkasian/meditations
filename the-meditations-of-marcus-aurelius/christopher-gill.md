Title: The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius  
Author: Christopher Gill  
Year: 2011  

From my grandfather Verus, nobility of character and evenness of temper.  

---
From the reputation of my father and what I remember of him, modesty and manliness. 

---
From my mother, piety and generosity, and to abstain not only from doing wrong but even from contemplating
such an act; and the simplicity, too, of her way of life, far removed from that of the rich.  

---
From my great-grandfather, that I never had to attend the public schools, but benefited from good teachers at
home, and to have come to realize that this is a matter on which one should spare no expense.

---
From my tutor, not to have sided with the Greens or the Blues [at the chariot-races] or the gladiators with the
long shields or short ones; to endure hardship, and have few needs; to do things for myself and not meddle in the
affairs of others; and to turn a deaf ear to slander.

---
From Diognetus, not to become obsessed with trivialities, and not to believe the claims of miracle-mongers and
charlatans about incantations and the expulsion of demons and the like; not to engage in quail-fighting or become
excited over other pursuits of that kind; to be willing to tolerate plain speaking; to have become familiar with
philosophy, and to have attended the lectures first of Baccheius, and then of Tandasis and Marcianus; to have
written compositions as a boy; to have wished for a plank bed covered only with a skin and for everything that
formed part of the Greek discipline.

---
From Rusticus: I gained the idea that my character was in need of correction and cultivation; and from him I
learned not to be led astray into a passion for rhetoric, and not to write treatises on purely theoretical matters, or
deliver little moralizing sermons, or play the ascetic or the benefactor in a manner calculated to impress; to abstain
from oratory, and verse, and fine language, and not to walk around the house in ceremonial clothing, or indulge in
other such vanities; to write letters in an unaffected style, as he did when he wrote to my mother from Sinuessa; with
regard to those who have angered or wronged me, to be easily recalled to my usual frame of mind, and to be easily
reconciled as soon as they are willing to make a move in my direction; to read with care and attention, and not be
satisfied with a superficial impression; not to agree too quickly with those who talk with a fluent tongue; and finally,
it was through him that I came to know the Discourses of Epictetus, as he lent me a copy from his own library.

---

From Apollonius: inner freedom, and to be decisive without leaving anything to chance; to look to no other
guide, even for an instant, than reason alone; to remain ever the same, in the face of severe pain, after losing a child,
or during long illnesses; to see clearly from his living example that a person can be extremely energetic and yet
relaxed; not to become irritable when expounding a text; and to see in him someone who clearly regarded the skill
and fluency that he showed in communicating philosophical doctrines as the least of his gifts; and to learn how one
should accept from friends what pass for apparent favours without lowering oneself as a result or showing an
insensitive disregard.

---
From Sextus: a kindly disposition and the example of a household governed by the father of the house; the idea
of what it means to live in accordance with nature; gravity without affectation, and a careful regard for the interests
of one’s friends; patience towards the unlearned and those whose opinions are not founded on methodical reflection.
The example of one who could accommodate himself to all kinds of people, so that his conversation was more
charming than any flattery, while at the same time he aroused the deepest respect from those who associated with
him. To show a sure grasp and methodical approach in searching out and ordering the principles necessary for life.
And he never displayed even a sign of anger or of any other passion, but seemed at once to be completely free of
passion and full of affection for his fellow human beings; and to be ready to praise, without being too demonstrative,
and to possess extensive knowledge without making a show of it.

---
From Alexander the grammarian: not to be over-critical; and not to interrupt and correct those who have
employed a solecism or some outlandish or discordant expression, but rather to suggest adroitly the very expression
which ought to have been used while professing to offer a reply or some further confirmation, or to join in a debate
on the matter itself rather than the diction, or to use some other tactful procedure to suggest the right expression in
an indirect fashion.

---
From Fronto: to have some conception of the malice, caprice, and hypocrisy that accompany absolute rule; and
that, on the whole, those whom we rank as patricians are somewhat lacking in natural affection.

---
From Alexander the Platonist: that we should not often or without due necessity either say to anyone or write in
a letter, ‘I am too busy’, nor in this way should we constantly try to evade the obligations imposed on us by our
social relationships by pleading the excuse of urgent business.

---
From Catulus: not to disregard a rebuke from a friend, even if his criticism may be unreasonable, but to try to
restore him to his usual frame of mind; to offer unstinting praise to one’s teachers, as is recorded of Athenodotus and
Domitius; and to show genuine love to one’s children.

---
From [my brother] Severus: love for one’s family, for truth, for justice; that through him I came to know
Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dio, Brutus, and to conceive the idea of a balanced constitution, and of government
founded on equity and freedom of speech, and of a monarchy which values above all things the freedom of the
subject; and from him too a consistent and unfailing respect for philosophy; and a readiness to help others, and
open-handed generosity; to be of good hope, and trust in the affection of one’s friends; and how he would be
completely open with those who incurred his disapproval, and that his friends never had to resort to conjecture about
what he wished or did not wish, for it was plain to see.

---
From Maximus: to be master of oneself, and never waver in one’s resolve; to be cheerful when ill, or in any
other predicament; the example of a character marked by a harmonious blend of gentleness and gravity; to set to
work on the task at hand without complaint. And the confidence he inspired in everyone that what he was saying
was just what he thought, and that whatever he did was done with no bad intent; never to be surprised or
discontented; and never to act in haste, or hang back, or be at a loss, or be downcast, and never to fawn on others or,
on the other hand, be irascible or suspicious. To be beneficent, and ready to forgive, and free from guile; to give the
impression of being someone who never deviates from what is right rather than one who has to be kept on the right
path; and how nobody would ever have imagined that Maximus looked down on him, or yet have presumed to
suppose that he was better than Maximus; and to be of good humour.

---
From my [adoptive] father: to be gentle, and to hold immovably to judgements arrived after careful
consideration; to be free from vain conceit with regard to worldly honours; zest for work and perseverance; to lend a
ready ear to those who have anything to propose for the common benefit; never to be deflected from rewarding each
person according to his deserts; to know by experience when to exert oneself and when to relax; to put a check on
pederastic love affairs; regard for the feelings of others, and how he would not always insist that his friends should
attend his table or accompany him on his travels, and how they would always find him ever the same if they had
been kept away by other business. At sessions of the council, to examine every question with scrupulous care, and
to be patient, as it was not his way to cut short any enquiry because he was satisfied with first impressions; to hold to
one’s friends, and never be fickle in one’s affections, or give way to infatuations; to be self-sufficient in every
respect, and to show a cheerful face to the world; to look far ahead, and plan even the smallest matters in advance,
without making a song and dance about it. How he put a curb on public acclamations and every kind of flattery
during his reign; and the care that he constantly devoted to the needs of the empire, and his prudent stewardship of
the public revenues, and his willingness to put up with the criticisms that such economies provoked. With regard to
the gods, to be free from superstitious fears; and with regard to people, not to court public favour by seeking to
please at any price or pandering to the mob; but sobriety in all things, and firmness, and never a trace of vulgarity or
lust for novelty.

The things that contribute to the comfort of life, of which fortune had granted him copious supply, he used
without ostentation, but also without apology, so as to enjoy them unaffectedly when they were at hand, but to feel
no need of them when they were not. No one would have described him as a sophist, or obsequiously servile, or a
pedant, but rather as a man of maturity and accomplishment who was inaccessible to flattery and well able to preside
over his own affairs and those of others.

In addition to all this, he had a high respect for genuine philosophers, but towards the other sort he was not
unduly disparaging, but neither on the other hand was he readily taken in by them; and further, his approachability
and good humour, though not taken to excess; and how he cared for his body with due moderation without valuing
his life at too high a rate or being concerned about his outward appearance, but also without neglecting it, and in
such a way that, because of his own attentions, he rarely had need of a doctor’s help, or medicines, or external
treatment. And most admirable too was his readiness to give way without jealousy to those who possessed some
special ability, such as eloquence or a knowledge of law and custom and the like, and how he did his best to ensure
that each of them gained the recognition that he deserved because of his eminence in his particular field; and how he
would always act according to established tradition, without making a show of the fact that he was following
established tradition. Furthermore, he was not changeable or capricious, but remained faithful to the same places and
the same practices; and after severe bouts of headache, he would return to his usual occupations at once and with
renewed vigour; and his secrets were not many, but few and far between, and even those were only in connection
with affairs of state; and he showed good sense and moderation in the provision of public spectacles, the
construction of buildings, the distribution of largesse, and the like, looking only to what ought to be done, and not to
the reputation that he would gain from having done it.

It was not his way to take baths at unreasonable hours, and he was not over-fond of building, and he attached
little importance to his food, or to the fabric and colour of his garments, or to the attractiveness of his slaves. His
clothing was sent up from his country house at Lorium, and most other things from Lanuvium. How he behaved to
the tax-collector at Tusculum who asked for his forgiveness, and his general conduct in such matters. He was never
harsh, or implacable, or overbearing, nor, as the saying goes, was he the sort of man who ‘gets into a sweat’; but
everything was planned out in every detail, as if at leisure, and calmly, methodically, vigorously, and consistently. What is reported of Socrates applies just as well to him, that he was equally able to enjoy or to abstain from those
things that many are too weak to abstain from and too self-indulgent in enjoying. To show strength and endurance,
and show restraint in either case, is the mark of a man who possesses a well-balanced and invincible character, as
was demonstrated by Maximus during [his final] illness.

From the gods: to have had good grandparents, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good companions,
relations, and friends, almost without exception; and that with regard to none of them did I ever lapse into any
serious offence, although my disposition was such that I might well have behaved in such a manner if circumstances
had favoured it; but through the grace of the gods, no conjunction of circumstances ever developed which would
have put me to the test. That I was not brought up any longer than I was with my grandfather’s concubine, and that
I preserved my youthful innocence and did not play a man’s part before the proper season, but even deferred it until
somewhat later. That I was placed under a ruler and a father who was able to rid me of all my vanity, and to lead me
to understand that it is possible to live at court and yet have no need of bodyguards, or embroidered robes, or
candelabra and statues and pompous trappings of that kind, but that it is possible for a prince to restrict himself to
something very close to the style of a private citizen, without lowering his status as a result or neglecting any of the
duties that a ruler must perform on behalf of the public.

To have had such a brother, who by his character was able to stimulate me to cultivate my own nature, and yet
at the same time heartened me by his respect and affection; that my children were not untalented or physically
deformed; that I was not more proficient at rhetoric, poetry, and other pursuits in which I might well have become
engrossed if I had felt that I was making good progress; that I was not slow to advance my tutors to the honours
which they seemed to desire, and that I did not put them off with the hope that, since they were still young, I would
do so at a later date; to have come to know Apollonius, Rusticus, and Maximus; to have clearly and regularly
pictured to myself the proper meaning of a life according to nature, so that, in so far as it depends on the gods and
on communications, assistance, and inspiration from the divine, there is nothing to prevent me from living according
to nature straight away, although I still fall somewhat short of this by my own fault and by failing to heed the
reminders and, one might almost say, the instructions of the gods.

That my body has held out all this time in the midst of such a life as mine; that I never touched Benedicta or
Theodotus, but that even afterwards, when I did fall prey to the passions of love, I was cured of them; that although
I was often angry with Rusticus, I never resorted to measures that I would have regretted; that although my mother
was destined to die at an early age, she at least spent her last years with me; that whenever I wanted to help
somebody who was short of money or needed assistance in some other respect, I never had to hear that I lacked the
means to do so, and that I for my own part never fell into such need as to require assistance from another; that my
wife is such as she is, so obedient, so affectionate, so straightforward; that I have been provided with suitable tutors
for my children; that remedies have been granted to me through dreams, especially against blood-spitting and
vertigo, and that I received the response from the oracle at Caieta; that when I conceived a passion for philosophy,
I did not fall in with any sophist, nor did I sit down to pore over books or work out syllogisms or busy myself with
speculations about matters in the heavens.

For all these things require the help of the gods and of fortune.
